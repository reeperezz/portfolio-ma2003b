Missing values:
- Some survey items contain missing values for a minority of observations. The notebook applies reasonable preprocessing (filtering / imputation / dropping depending on analysis step) before factor analysis and modeling.

Usage suggestions:
- Use this file as a quick reference when communicating findings to stakeholders.
- If you want a CSV export with simple definitions, I can create `data_dictionary.csv` with columns `variable,name,description,type,example`.

If you want me to add example distributions (mean, min, max, % missing) for each variable, I can compute and append them to this file or create a companion `DATA_SUMMARY.md`.
